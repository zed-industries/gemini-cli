 * commands from a specific source (e.g., built-in code, local files).
 *
 * The CommandService is responsible for invoking these loaders, aggregating their
 * results, and resolving any name conflicts. This architecture allows the command

   * This factory method orchestrates the entire command loading process. It
   * runs all provided loaders in parallel, aggregates their results, handles
   * name conflicts for extension commands by renaming them, and then returns a
   * fully constructed `CommandService` instance.
   *
   * Conflict resolution:
   * - Extension commands that conflict with existing commands are renamed to
   *   `extensionName.commandName`
   * - Non-extension commands (built-in, user, project) override earlier commands
   *   with the same name based on loader order
   *
   * @param loaders An array of objects that conform to the `ICommandLoader`
   *   interface. Built-in commands should come first, followed by FileCommandLoader.
   * @param signal An AbortSignal to cancel the loading process.
   * @returns A promise that resolves to a new, fully initialized `CommandService` instance.
